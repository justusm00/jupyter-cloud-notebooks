    "The modeling of a lot of systems will require the use of random numbers. Unfortunately, these are quite difficult to generate on a purely deterministically working computer. While most modern devices actually *do* accumulate a pool of entropy from certain sources (like hardware timings), the stream of random bits is mainly useful for resourceful cryptographic applications. Running simulations, for examples of SDEs, requires much more randomness than ordinary hardware can provide.\n",

    "Your options are either using specialized hardware, or incorporating a *Pseudo Random Number Generator* (PRNG).\n",
    "\n",
    "A PRNG is a deterministic algorithm that generates sequences of numbers, that show properties and qualities of a \"true\" random sequence. If you are interested, you can take a look at statistical test suits like the [*Diehard tests*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diehard_tests) to see what tests are typically performed to evaluate a PRNG.\n",
